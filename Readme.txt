This is a sample nodejs script to access Mashape using REST.  It's accessing the bitly API.

You would need to put in a Mashape authorization header to get this to work.  For that, you need to sign up for a Mashape account at http://www.mashape.com/ 

You can get the header from the Mashape REST docs at https://www.mashape.com/docs/consume/rest

Get your Bitly key - refer to the "Authentication Settings" at https://www.mashape.com/ismaelc/bitly-2 for the links to get your key.

Send your questions to chris@mashape.com.  Enjoy!
